# Hypertube
This project proposes to create a web application that allows the user to research and watch videos.

# The player will be directly integrated to the site, and the videos will be downloaded
through the BitTorrent protocol.

# The research engine will interrogate multiple external sources of your choice, like for
example http://www.legittorrents.info, or even https://archive.org.
Once the element selected, it will be downloaded from the server and streamed on the
web player at the same time. Which means that the player wonâ€™t only show the video
once the download is completed, but will be able to stream directly the video feed.
